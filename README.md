# Battleship

Play the fun game, Battleship, where you will place boats, and play against the computer AI, try it out!
## Funcionalities

- Place your ship where you click! 
- Toggle the ship placement between horizontal and vertical!
- Attack your enemy board by clicking and be attacked!
- A fully functional computer AI with some inteligence (when it hits, it tries again closer to where it just hit)


## Practiced Skills
This project was intended mostly to practice TDD! it was a test first development and it really helped to make sure the functionalities were in order before I implemented user interaction! The making of an AI was also an interesting challenge... since I had to give general structures to a machine, and it needs to behave in a dynamic matter in order to play the game.

Another very important aspect of this project was using NPM for the first time, it really helps a lot to add modules and functionalities to help the development, one of wich is the ever important module bundler: webpack.
